.TH HSH 1 "January 2025" "Version 1.0" "Simple Shell Manual"

.SH NAME
hsh - simple command-line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.br
.B echo "command" | hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command-line interpreter that mimics basic functionality of
.BR sh (1).
It can run in both interactive and non-interactive modes, executing commands by searching for them in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

.SH MODES

.SS Interactive Mode
In interactive mode,
.B hsh
displays a prompt
.B (#cisfun$ )
and waits for the user to type a command. After executing the command, the shell displays the prompt again and waits for the next command.

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
In non-interactive mode, .B hsh reads commands from standard input or from a file and executes them without displaying a prompt.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
Commands are executed by:
.IP 1. 4
Parsing the input line into command and arguments
.IP 2. 4
If the command contains a '/', it is treated as a path
.IP 3. 4
Otherwise, the command is searched for in the PATH environment variable
.IP 4. 4
If found, the command is executed using
.BR execve (2)
.IP 5. 4
The parent process waits for the child to complete

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
Currently, this shell does not implement any built-in commands. All commands are external programs.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for commands.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
exits with the following values:
.TP
.B 0
Successful execution
.TP
.B 127
Command not found
.TP
.B Other
Exit status of the last executed command

.SH EXAMPLES

.SS Interactive Mode .nf $ ./hsh #cisfun$ ls -la total 32 drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 15 10:30 . drwxr-xr-x 3 user user 4096 Jan 15 10:00 .. -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 8760 Jan 15 10:30 hsh #cisfun$ pwd /home/user/simple_shell #cisfun$ exit .fi

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
.nf
$ echo "ls" | ./hsh
file1.txt  file2.txt  hsh

$ echo -e "pwd\nls -l" | ./hsh /home/user/simple_shell total 16 -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 150 Jan 15 10:30 file1.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 200 Jan 15 10:30 file2.txt -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 8760 Jan 15 10:30 hsh .fi

.SH ERROR HANDLING
When a command is not found, the shell displays an error message in the format:
.br
.B shell_name: 1: command: not found
